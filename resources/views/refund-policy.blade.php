                <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 01/06/2024</p>
                <p><strong>Approved By:</strong> Chairman Board of Trustees</p>
                <p><strong>Policy Owner:</strong> Compliance Department</p>
                <p><strong>Review Date:</strong> 02/06/2024</p>

                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Cruzada Network International (CNI) is dedicated to providing exceptional service to its customers, donors, and partners while maintaining compliance with the necessary legal and regulatory standards. This refund policy is designed to ensure clarity and transparency regarding the procedures for requesting and processing refunds. We aim to address any potential financial discrepancies in a fair and timely manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our policy outlines the specific conditions under which refunds may be granted, in line with our commitment to customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. By establishing these guidelines, CNI seeks to prevent misuse of our platform and ensure that all transactions are accurately reflected and appropriately handled.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Scope</h2>
                <p>
                    This refund policy applies to all types of transactions made through Cruzada Network International, including but not limited to donations, payments for services, and grants. It is designed to cover the steps for requesting refunds, the conditions under which refunds may be granted, and the associated processing time. Our aim is to ensure that our clients and donors are fully aware of their rights and responsibilities regarding refunds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CNI engages with a wide range of stakeholders including donors, vendors, and beneficiaries, and it is crucial that all parties understand when and how refunds may be applicable. This policy helps set clear expectations and promotes an understanding of the situations where refunds may or may not be appropriate.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Eligibility for Refunds</h2>
                <p>
                    Refunds will be granted under specific circumstances to ensure fairness in our financial dealings. One of the main situations where a refund may be issued is if a transaction is completed erroneously, such as in cases of duplicate payments or incorrect amounts being processed. Similarly, refunds may be granted for unauthorized transactions, where there is evidence that the payment was made without the account holder’s approval.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, refunds can be considered in cases where CNI fails to deliver the agreed-upon services or when services are significantly delayed beyond acceptable timeframes. In cases where overpayments have occurred, the excess amount will be returned to the original payer, as long as proper documentation and proof of overpayment are provided.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Non-Refundable Transactions</h2>
                <p>
                    Certain transactions will be considered final and non-refundable to maintain operational integrity and compliance with our policies. One such example includes donations made voluntarily by individuals or organizations. Donations are regarded as contributions that help further our mission and as such, are not refundable once they have been processed. This policy is in place to ensure that the intentions behind each donation are honored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, any payments made for services that have already been delivered in full by CNI will not be eligible for refunds. This includes services provided either directly by CNI or through third-party vendors associated with our platform. This policy ensures that once value has been received, financial obligations are considered complete, barring exceptional circumstances.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Refund Process</h2>
                <p>
                    Refund requests must be submitted in writing within 30 days of the original transaction to be considered valid. The written request should contain the transaction reference number, a detailed explanation of why the refund is being requested, and any supporting documentation that can validate the claim. This information helps streamline the review process and ensures that requests are handled efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon receiving the refund request, CNI will send an acknowledgment of receipt within five business days. The request will then be thoroughly reviewed to assess its validity and compliance with our refund policy. If the refund request is approved, it will be processed and refunded to the original payment method or bank account associated with the transaction. The entire process, from submission to approval, typically takes between 10-15 business days.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Timeframe for Refund Processing</h2>
                <p>
                    Refunds are processed based on the complexity and nature of each individual case. Once a refund request has been submitted, CNI will promptly acknowledge the request within five business days. During this time, our team will begin the verification process to ensure that the claim meets the eligibility criteria outlined in our policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Refunds will be processed within 10-15 business days from the date of receipt of a valid refund request. In cases where the claim is particularly complex, CNI may require additional time to review and validate all necessary documentation. However, we strive to resolve all refund requests in a timely manner and will keep the requester informed throughout the process.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>
                    In the event that a refund request is denied, the requester has the right to appeal the decision. Appeals should be submitted to CNI’s Compliance Department within 10 business days of receiving the denial notification. The appeal should provide additional information or clarification to support the initial refund request. Our Compliance Department will carefully re-examine the case and make a decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the appeal is accepted, the refund will be processed following the procedures outlined in this policy. If the appeal is denied, the decision will be final, and no further action will be taken. Cruzada Network International is committed to ensuring that each dispute is handled fairly, and all stakeholders will be treated with respect during the process.
                </p>
