                <h2>2. Scope of Services</h2>
                <p>CNI provides a variety of services aimed at facilitating donations, grants, and financial transactions for nonprofit and social impact initiatives. Our platform allows individuals, corporations, and other entities to contribute funds for charitable purposes and other related activities.</p>
                <p>We also partner with third-party vendors and payment processors to ensure secure transactions. The services we offer may be subject to limitations, and certain functionalities may be restricted to authorized users or specific regions. CNI does not guarantee the availability of its services at all times and may modify or discontinue any aspect of the platform without prior notice.</p>

                <h2>3. User Obligations</h2>
                <p>As a user of CNI’s platform, you agree to provide accurate and complete information during registration and transaction processes. This includes, but is not limited to, your personal details, payment information, and any other relevant documentation. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and must immediately notify CNI of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
                <p>By using our services, you agree not to engage in activities that are fraudulent, illegal, or harmful to CNI, its users, or its partners. This includes attempts to disrupt the functionality of the platform, unauthorized access to user data, or misuse of any financial contributions. Failure to comply with these obligations may result in suspension or termination of your account, as well as potential legal action.</p>

                <h2>4. Donations and Payments</h2>
                <p>All donations made through the CNI platform are voluntary, and the donor acknowledges that the funds contributed are for charitable purposes. Once a donation is processed, it is considered final and non-refundable unless otherwise specified in our Refund Policy.
